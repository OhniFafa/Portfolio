  Summary: "I possess experience with full stack web developement. <br>As a programmer, I enjoy solving problems and building new things by coding. At the same time, I devote myself to coding cleanly. <br>My faiths are following: <ul><li>\"Do things interesting or useful.\" - In leisure time, I love learning new things out of interest or their usefulness.</li><li>\"Partners get more sensible, communication gets easier.\" - In company, I am delighted to shared knowledge and mentored freshmen. </li><li>\"Do right things. Make things right. Ensure the 'right' is right.\" -  So, I become a novice of Test-Driven-Development recently.</li></ul>",
